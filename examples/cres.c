/* cell resampling using C
 *
 * To run this example, first download the cres library from
 * https://github.com/a-maier/cres/releases
 *
 * Alternatively, compile the library running
 * ```
 * cargo build --release
 * ```
 * in the directory containing `Cargo.toml`. To compile with support for
 * ROOT ntuple files instead use
 * ```
 * cargo build --release --features=ntuple
 * ```
 * and similar for other features described in the Readme.
 *
 * Then copy the compiled libraries (`libcres.a` and `libcres.so` on
 * linux) and the generated header `cres.h` to a directory where
 * they can be found by your C compiler.
 *
 * Now compile the example, for example with
 * ```
 * cc -o cres examples/cres.c -lcres -lm
 * ```
 *
 * Finally, run with
 * ```
 * ./cres INFILES OUTDIR
 * ```
